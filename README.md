Welcome in our company !!  
We only hire interns so now our programs are broken.  

We are lucky somebody wrote specs but we don't know how to proceed.  

Please fix our broken program so tests are green.  

You also need to finish search_script.rb for our CEO so he can search the Web safely  
Please create an interface in command line (CLI) so he can choose which site we wants to query.

He tends to make mistake, so be careful of wrong inputs.  

Update dependencies  
$ `bundle install`

Start tests  
$ `rspec`

Starts syntax enforcer  
$ `rubocop`

Starts Search Script  
$ `ruby bin/search_script.rb`
